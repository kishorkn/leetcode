## üöÄ Goals

* **Sharpen problem-solving skills** 
* **Master new algorithms and data structures**
* **Track my progress and growth**
* **Share my solutions and learn from others**

## üìÇ Structure

The repository is organized by problem difficulty:

* **Easy:**  Contains solutions to easy-level LeetCode problems.
* **Medium:** Contains solutions to medium-level LeetCode problems.
* **Hard:**  Contains solutions to hard-level LeetCode problems.

Within each difficulty level, solutions are organized by problem number. Each problem has its own directory containing:

* **Problem description:** A `README.md` file with the problem statement.
* **Solution:** One or more code files with my solution(s) in various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
* **Explanation:** A detailed explanation of the solution approach and any relevant concepts.
